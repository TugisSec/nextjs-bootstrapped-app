# Android To-Do List App – Detailed Implementation Plan

This plan details a native Android To-Do List App using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It covers core functionality, custom reminders with full-screen overlays, and bonus features such as task progress charts, category tags, and search/filter.

---

## 1. Project Setup and Dependencies

- **Project Creation**  
  • Create a new Android project using Android Studio with Kotlin support and Jetpack Compose enabled.

- **Gradle Configuration**  
  • **Project-level build.gradle**: Ensure proper Gradle version and SDK configurations.  
  • **App-level build.gradle**:  
    - Add dependencies:  
      - Jetpack Compose libraries (`androidx.compose.ui:ui`, `androidx.compose.material3`, `androidx.compose.material-icons-core`, etc.)  
      - Lifecycle and Activity Compose (`androidx.activity:activity-compose`)  
      - Room Database (`androidx.room:room-runtime` with kapt for annotation processing)  
      - WorkManager (`androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx`)  
    - Configure Kotlin and enable Jetpack Compose.

---

## 2. AndroidManifest.xml Modifications

- **Permissions**  
  • Add:  
    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW" />
    ```
- **Activity Declarations**  
  • Declare the two main activities:  
    - **MainActivity** (Launcher)  
    - **AlarmActivity**: Set with a full-screen, no-action-bar theme and appropriate launch flags so it displays over the lock screen.

---

## 3. Data Layer – Room Database

- **File: TaskEntity.kt**  
  • Create a data class (`@Entity`) containing:  
    - id (primary key)  
    - title, description  
    - dueDate (timestamp)  
    - isComplete (boolean)  
    - repeatType (enum: DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, CUSTOM)  
    - repeatInterval (for custom intervals)  
    - repeatEndCondition (either count or an endDate)  
    - customSoundUri (String, URI for selected sound)  
    - category (optional color tag)

- **File: TaskDao.kt**  
  • Define CRUD operations:  
    - Insert, update, delete task  
    - Query pending tasks (for reminders and search/filter)

- **File: TaskDatabase.kt**  
  • Create an abstract class extending `RoomDatabase`  
  • Include migration strategies, error handling (try-catch in Repository usage), and singleton instance creation.

---

## 4. UI Layer Using Jetpack Compose

### Main Navigation and Scaffold

- **File: MainActivity.kt**  
  • Set up a `Scaffold` using Compose with a BottomNavigationBar containing three items:  
    - Tasks  
    - Add Task  
    - Settings  
  • Integrate Jetpack Navigation Compose for switching between screens.

### Task Listing Screen

- **File: HomeScreen.kt**  
  • Use a `LazyColumn` to display tasks with:  
    - Slide-in animations and animated checkmarks when marking complete  
    - Swipe-to-delete functionality with confirmation dialogs  
    - A search bar at the top to filter tasks by title or category

### Add/Edit Task Screen

- **File: AddEditTaskScreen.kt**  
  • Build a form including:  
    - TextFields for title and description  
    - Date/time picker for due date/time  
    - Repeat option selectors (radio buttons/dropdown for Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Custom)  
    - When Custom is selected, input fields for the interval and end condition (either count or a date)  
    - Validation logic with inline error messages (e.g., missing title, invalid interval)

### Settings Screen

- **File: SettingsScreen.kt**  
  • Allow the user to select a custom sound:  
    - Use the Media Picker API (via an Intent with `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT` for audio files)  
    - Store the selected sound’s URI (do not store the file)  
    - Option to revert to a default ringtone  
  • Include a dark mode toggle and other simple app settings.

### Bonus Features (Optional)

- **File: ChartScreen.kt**  
  • Display a progress chart using Canvas to render a bar/line graph for weekly/monthly task completions.

- **Category & Filter**  
  • In AddEditTaskScreen, include selection of a category color (simple color picker built from Compose color swatches).  
  • In HomeScreen, extend the search to filter by categories.

---

## 5. Reminder and Alarm Functionality

### Full-Screen Alarm Display

- **File: AlarmActivity.kt**  
  • Design a full-screen Compose-based activity with:  
    - An animated, flashing background (using Compose’s animation APIs)  
    - A prominent reminder message (e.g., “Reminder: You have pending tasks!”)  
    - Two buttons: “Snooze” and “Dismiss”  
  • Ensure the activity uses window flags/attributes to display as a system overlay, even when locked.

### Reminder Worker

- **File: ReminderWorker.kt**  
  • Extend `Worker` (or `CoroutineWorker`) to:  
    - Query the Room database for tasks not marked complete and whose due time has passed  
    - Trigger the alarm by launching `AlarmActivity` using an Intent with the `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK` flag  
    - Schedule hourly reminders via WorkManager  
    - Implement retry logic and proper error logging.

---

## 6. Utility Classes and Best Practices

- **Utils and Helpers**  
  • **DateUtils.kt & RepeatUtils.kt**: Handle date parsing, formatting, and repeat logic calculations.  
  • Ensure proper error handling by wrapping database access and background operations in try-catch blocks with appropriate logging.

- **Architecture and State Management**  
  • Use MVVM architecture:  
    - Create a `TaskViewModel.kt` to manage task state and communicate with the database  
    - Use LiveData/StateFlow to update UI in response to database changes and background events.

---

## 7. UI/UX Considerations

- **Modern, Minimalist Styling**  
  • Adopt a flat, neutral color palette with accent highlights defined in `colors.xml` and themed in Compose’s MaterialTheme.  
  • Ensure all UI elements maintain clear hierarchy with proper typography and spacing.
  
- **Animations and Transitions**  
  • Utilize Compose’s animation APIs for smooth transitions:  
    - Slide-in animations on task cards  
    - Animated checkmarks for task completion updates  
    - A vibrant, attention-grabbing alert animation in AlarmActivity.

- **Error Handling in UI**  
  • Display inline error messages in forms (e.g., invalid repeat options)  
  • Confirm critical actions (e.g., task deletion) using alert dialogs

---

## 8. File Structure Overview

- **/app/build.gradle** – App-level Gradle configuration for dependencies and Compose settings.
- **/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml** – Permissions (e.g., SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) and activity declarations.
- **/app/src/main/java/com/example/todo/MainActivity.kt** – Main entry with bottom navigation and navigation graph.
- **/app/src/main/java/com/example/todo/data/**  
  - TaskEntity.kt  
  - TaskDao.kt  
  - TaskDatabase.kt
- **/app/src/main/java/com/example/todo/ui/screens/**  
  - HomeScreen.kt  
  - AddEditTaskScreen.kt  
  - SettingsScreen.kt  
  - ChartScreen.kt (bonus)
- **/app/src/main/java/com/example/todo/ui/components/**  
  - TaskCard.kt – A composable for rendering each task with animations.
- **/app/src/main/java/com/example/todo/worker/ReminderWorker.kt** – Worker class for scheduling hourly reminders.
- **/app/src/main/java/com/example/todo/AlarmActivity.kt** – Activity displaying the full-screen, flashing alarm overlay.
- **/app/src/main/res/values/**  
  - colors.xml and themes.xml – Define theme colors, dark mode support, and styles.
